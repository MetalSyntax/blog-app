      "My music is at once ambient & electronic, experimental, raw and powerful. I play an eclectic mix of music, from ambient-based tracks to electronic-based tracks, and have recently collaborated with a Brazilian creative DJ. The music I make is often influenced by my own experiences, and the lives around me. I am also a producer & musician, and have been involved in the industry for over five years.",
